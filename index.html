    <h2>What is a Living Lab?</h2>
    <p>
        A Living Lab is a real-world environment where communities, researchers,
        and innovators collaborate to solve practical challenges through
        experimentation and co-creation.
    </p>
    <h2>About Us</h2>

<pre style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">We are a collaborative social innovation platform built to connect communities, NGOs, and colleges through a structured Living Lab ecosystem.
Our goal is simple:
To ensure that local problems receive local solutions by empowering college students and NGOs to work together on real issues reported by citizens.</pre>
<h3>Who We Are?</h3>
<pre style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">We are a team of educators, students, technologists, and social partners who believe that colleges should play an active role in community development.
By associating colleges with NGOs and organizing them into domain-based Living Labs, we create a system where learning goes beyond classrooms and directly benefits society.</pre>

<h3>What We Do?</h3>
<pre style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
•	Enable citizens to report local issues digitally
•	Route problems to the nearest relevant college Living Lab
•	Support student-led problem solving with NGO guidance
•	Encourage practical, sustainable, and scalable solutions
•	Ensure transparency through updates and impact tracking</pre>

<h3>Our Approach</h3>
<pre style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
    We follow a Living Lab–driven approach, where:
•	Real problems come from real communities
•	Students work on real challenges
•	NGOs guide real-world implementation
•	This ensures solutions are practical, inclusive, and impactful.</pre>

<h3>Why We Exist</h3>
<pre style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
Many local issues remain unresolved due to lack of coordination between communities, institutions, and organizations.
We exist to bridge this gap by creating a single platform where:
•	Communities are heard.
•	Colleges act as solution hubs.
•	NGOs strengthen their outreach.
•	Students gain real-world experience.</pre>

<h3>Our Belief</h3>
<pre style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">We believe:
•	Every local problem deserves attention
•	Students are powerful agents of change
•	Collaboration creates stronger solutions
•	Education must serve society</pre>

<h3>Our Vision</h3>
<pre style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">To build a nationwide network of Living Labs where colleges, NGOs, and communities work together to create sustainable social impact.
Our Mission:
    •	To connect education with community needs.
    •	To promote student-led innovation.
    •	To solve local problems efficiently and ethically.
    •	To build long-term community partnerships.
    •	Working Together for Change.

We are committed to creating a future where technology, education, and social responsibility come together to solve real-world challenges—one community at a time.</pre>
