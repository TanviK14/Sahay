    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <pre style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">We are a collaborative social innovation platform built to connect communities, NGOs, and colleges through a structured Living Lab ecosystem.
    Our goal is simple:
    To ensure that local problems receive local solutions by empowering college students and NGOs to work together on real issues reported by citizens.</pre>
    <h3>Who We Are?</h3>
    <pre style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">We are a team of educators, students, technologists, and social partners who believe that colleges should play an active role in community development.
    By associating colleges with NGOs and organizing them into domain-based Living Labs, we create a system where learning goes beyond classrooms and directly benefits society.</pre>

    <h3>What We Do?</h3>
    <pre style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
    •	Enable citizens to report local issues digitally
    •	Route problems to the nearest relevant college Living Lab
    •	Support student-led problem solving with NGO guidance
    •	Encourage practical, sustainable, and scalable solutions
    •	Ensure transparency through updates and impact tracking</pre>

    <h3>Our Approach</h3>
    <pre style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        We follow a Living Lab–driven approach, where:
    •	Real problems come from real communities
    •	Students work on real challenges
    •	NGOs guide real-world implementation
    •	This ensures solutions are practical, inclusive, and impactful.</pre>

    <h3>Why We Exist</h3>
    <pre style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
    Many local issues remain unresolved due to lack of coordination between communities, institutions, and organizations.
    We exist to bridge this gap by creating a single platform where:
    •	Communities are heard.
    •	Colleges act as solution hubs.
    •	NGOs strengthen their outreach.
    •	Students gain real-world experience.</pre>

    <h3>Our Belief</h3>
    <pre style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">We believe:
    •	Every local problem deserves attention
    •	Students are powerful agents of change
    •	Collaboration creates stronger solutions
    •	Education must serve society</pre>

    <h3>Our Vision</h3>
    <pre style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">To build a nationwide network of Living Labs where colleges, NGOs, and communities work together to create sustainable social impact.
    Our Mission:
        •	To connect education with community needs.
        •	To promote student-led innovation.
        •	To solve local problems efficiently and ethically.
        •	To build long-term community partnerships.
        •	Working Together for Change.

    We are committed to creating a future where technology, education, and social responsibility come together to solve real-world challenges—one community at a time.</pre>
